# What is it?

A basic template, including the example app from the Routify starter template, which gives Electron + Routify + Tailwindcss + Typescript + SCSS support out of the box with hot reloading.

It was built by adding everything ontop of the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) project template at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

Please double check the configuration before using as, while it works, I am not a front-end developer and this is not my forte.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

An Electron window will open automatically. Eventually.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
